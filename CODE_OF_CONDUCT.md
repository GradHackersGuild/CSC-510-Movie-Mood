# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Project Mission

Our project strives to create a collaborative, innovative, and inclusive environment for developers and contributors of all backgrounds. We are committed to building technology that reflects the values of accessibility, diversity, and respect. To achieve these goals, we believe that every contributor should feel valued, empowered, and free from discrimination or harassment, enabling us to bring our best ideas forward.

## Vision for Inclusivity and Collaboration

We envision a community where diverse perspectives are not only welcomed but celebrated. By fostering a collaborative environment that prioritizes mutual respect and inclusion, we aim to create a project that benefits from a range of ideas and experiences. With a strong commitment to our values, we seek to break down barriers and support the ongoing growth of each member. This Code of Conduct is foundational to our community as it outlines expectations for respectful and constructive interactions that allow us to create impactful technology together.

## Purpose of This Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct serves as a guideline for maintaining a positive and productive atmosphere for all participants. It defines acceptable behavior and the standards we expect from each contributor, creating an environment where everyone can work confidently and without fear of harassment or discrimination. This code reflects our shared responsibility to uphold our project’s values and protect the wellbeing of all community members.


## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to participate in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Guidelines

* Everyone in the group should ensure that they can be contacted easily by other members of the group by giving them adequate contact information
* When working in a group, please treat other members of the group with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if you do not necessarily agree with them
* You are expected to make a full and fair contribution to the work of the group
* When you agree to undertake a task that has been assigned to you by the group you must try to work to the agreed deadline since failure to do so could impede the          progress of the whole project
* You have the right, naturally, to challenge other’s opinions but please try to do it in a non-aggressive way
* It is your responsibility to attend all meetings arranged by the group to advance the project and to arrive at those meetings on time.  If you can’t attend a meeting of the group you should consider providing your input in written form and giving this to the other group members before the meeting
*	If another member of your group tells you something in confidence.

## Be Respectful
In particular, respect differences of opinion.

## Be Charitable
Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
When we do disagree, try to understand why.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct will apply both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

reported by contacting the project team at popcornpicks504@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good 
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
